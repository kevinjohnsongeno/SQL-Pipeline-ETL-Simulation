# SQL-Pipeline-ETL-Simulation
A mini data engineering project that demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow using SQLite and DB Browser. The project imports raw sales data (CSV), cleans and transforms it, loads it into a production table, and maintains an audit log for ETL tracking.
